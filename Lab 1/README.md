# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
**Setting:** 

A New York City residential area at night.

**Players:**

* User (Pedestrian #1)
  - Wearing the Pedestrian Safety Spotlight device
* Driver
* Cyclist
* Pedestrian #2
  - Without any device
* Resident sitting on stoop
  - Without any device

**Activity:**

* User (Pedestrian #1)
  - Wearing the Pedestrian Safety Spotlight device
  - Walking on sidewalk
* Driver
  - Driving on street
  - Turning corner quickly almost hitting User
* Cyclist
  - Parking bike on sidewalk rack, User passes by
* Pedestrian #2
  - Without any device
  - Walking on sidewalk in opposite direction of User
* Resident sitting on stoop
  - Without any device
  - Sitting on stoop watching what's going on in the neighborhood, User passes by

**Goals:**

* User (Pedestrian #1)
  - Wearing the Pedestrian Safety Spotlight device
  - Wants to walk safely on sidewalk
  - Wants to alert others of their presence
* Driver
  - Wants to turn around the corner quickly
* Cyclist
  - Wants to parking bike on sidewalk rack
* Pedestrian #2
  - Without any device
  - Wants to walk safely on sidewalk
* Resident sitting on stoop
  - Without any device
  - Wants to sit on the stoop and watch what's going on in the neighborhood


\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

![A7F12D5B-8DA2-4DD1-9827-F14A8848641B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93726317/187099545-4779c225-8e4e-45aa-9de3-2a460115ab97.JPG)

![46C3227B-553F-4C7F-B537-138673339348](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93726317/187099553-a8a4820f-9907-43d3-ad3c-2a6649894a97.JPG)



\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Using color in the storyboards could be helpful to provide further context around the different modes of the device.

* Default / 'No Glow': Grey
* 'Glow': Light blue
* 'Flash' / 'Alert': Red


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

Alerting the driver to the pedestrian's presence might end up being more distracting and potentially cause further accident if the driver ends up watching the pedestrian instead of the road ahead.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

 * Make colors and sound noticible but not overly distracting for the driver or other drivers on the road.
 * Add spotlight or flashlight capability for pedestrian practicality


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

Instructions were clear, thank you. There could be a step added to `$ pip3 install flask` before the `$ pip3 install flask-socketio` step for anyone who does not have Flask from previous projects.

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93726317/187270247-b7bfd0da-7ad1-4152-90d0-f1325e5dfc7d.mov


\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93726317/187276145-8b44e8e3-b267-4e5e-827e-c225859564a9.mov





## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

![IMG-4694](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93726317/187328159-64dc1d2a-e54d-4458-8aa2-04218ff3c8c4.jpg)


\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

* Device should be 
  - Lightweight to be comfortable for User while walking
  - Durable enough to endure walking / running impact and to withstand different weather conditions
  - Practical, such that users would feel it would be a useful addition to their walking routine
  - Aesthetically pleasing enough to have user want to wear it, but not distracting
* Light should be 
  - Bright enough to provide 'pedestrian presence indication' or provide a flashlight if users needs
  - Noticible but not distracting
* Speaker should be present to allow for audio alerts, if user desires

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

Starring:

* **Statue of Liberty** as *User wearing device while walking in NYC at night*
* **ep448** as *Driver turning corner quickly, almost injuring User but sees Pedestrian Safety Spotlight and avoids collision*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
